[scissors paper stone game](https://basics.rocketacademy.co/projects/project-1-scissors-paper-stone) for rocket academy's coding basics course

### v1.0
[part 1](https://basics.rocketacademy.co/projects/project-1-scissors-paper-stone/project-1-scissors-paper-stone-part-1)

#### base
- **basic scissors paper stone** player inputs one of "scissors", "paper", or "stone", the program internally randomly chooses scissors, paper, or stone, and the program outputs whether the player won, the program won, or it's a draw.
- **input validation** player types something other than "scissors", "paper", or "stone" during gameplay, program throws an error

### more comfortable
- **formatting** customising output
- **reverse game** a version where the rules are reversed. player triggers gameplay with the inputs of either "reversed scissors", "reversed paper", or "reversed stone"
